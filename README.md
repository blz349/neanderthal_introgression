# Impact of Neanderthal-introgressed sequence on innate immune response

Modern non-African populations contain 1.5-4% Neanderthal ancestry in their genomes as a result of interbreeding between early modern humans and Neanderthal approximately 50,000-60,000 years ago. While most Neanderthal sequences have a deleterious effect and undergo purifying selection, some Neanderthal alleles have been maintained at higher than expected frequencies and may confer a selective advantage, for example by facilitating environmental adaptation. Traits related to immunity are likely candidates for adaptive introgression from Neanderthals with implications for disease risk, and there is evidence that functional consequences of archaic alleles disproportionally involve regulatory effects on gene expression.

This project addresses the following questions: 
1.	Do Neanderthal-introgressed sequences function in innate immune pathways?
2.  Are Neanderthal-introgressed alleles associated with immune-related diseases (e.g. infectious disease, allergic disease, autoimmune and autoinflammatory disease)?
