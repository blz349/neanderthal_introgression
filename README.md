# Impact of Neanderthal introgressed sequence on extreme response to infection: a study of *ex vivo* responses to endotoxin and sepsis

Modern non-African populations contain 1.5-4% Neanderthal ancestry in their genomes as a result of interbreeding between early modern humans and Neanderthal approximately 50,000-60,000 years ago. While most Neanderthal sequences have a deleterious effect and undergo purifying selection, some Neanderthal alleles have been maintained at higher than expected frequencies and may confer a selective advantage, for example by facilitating environmental adaptation. Traits related to immunity are likely candidates for adaptive introgression from Neanderthals with implications for disease risk, and there is evidence that functional consequences of archaic alleles disproportionally involve regulatory effects on gene expression.

This project addresses the following questions: 
1.	Do Neanderthal-introgressed haplotypes show differences in frequency in genes differentially expressed in (1) *ex vivo* ‘extreme response’ (between high and low responders to endotoxin); (2) sepsis patients vs controls; (3) sepsis response states
2.	Are rare Neanderthal origin coding variants over- or under-represented in sepsis cases vs controls?
3.	Is there an excess of Neanderthal origin non-coding SNPs in observed eQTL that are (1) sepsis specific; (2) LPS-specific?
